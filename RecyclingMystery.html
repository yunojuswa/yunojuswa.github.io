                <h2>How to Dispose of Vape Waste Properly</h2>
                <p>When e-cigarettes, or vapes, came on the market in 2007, they were initially seen as 1) a healthier
                    alternative to smoking tobacco cigarettes and 2) a possible stepping stone to quitting smoking once
                    and for all. Unfortunately, the use of vapes has proven to have many
                    <a

                        risks</a>.
                </p>
                <p>Vaping has increased dramatically since they were introduced over a decade ago. The CDC reported in
                    2023 that teen vape usage is down to 10%, but 25% of those middle and high school students used
                    e-cigarettes daily. Their report also states that in 2020 over 17 million units of e-cigarettes were
                    sold in retail stores <em>over a four-week period</em> - including marijuana vapes. This translates
                    into
                    hundreds of millions of vaping products added to the waste stream every year.
                </p>
                <p>Some people originally thought vapes would be an environmental boon, since people wouldn’t be tossing

                    on the ground. But vaping presents its own environmental problems including toxic chemicals,
                    increased plastic, and electronic waste.

                <ul>
                    <li>A cartridge that holds the e-liquid</li>
                    <li>E-liquid containing propylene glycol, flavoring, and nicotine or THC</li>
                    <li>An atomizer that heats the liquid</li>

                <h2>Mixed Materials Mean a Recycling Headache</h2>
                <p>Vapes are made of a mix of materials — usually a combination of glass, metal, and plastic. This
                    combination makes it difficult to separate out any single material that might be recyclable. For
                    this reason alone, vaping products are not accepted in curbside recycling.</p>

                <h2>What’s in That E-Liquid?</h2>
                <p>The liquid in e-cigarettes contains nicotine and a host of other chemicals. Marijuana vapes contain
                    sticky THC oil, which makes recycling nearly impossible. Chemicals in e-liquid ingredients vary
                    widely among manufacturers and regulation of these ingredients is lacking.</p>

                <p>Nicotine can be poisonous to children, pets, and wildlife. If discarded as litter, the nicotine can
                    contaminate water systems. Don’t dispose of e-liquid in your garbage or recycling bin and never
                    rinse it down the drain.</p>

                <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has two websites about the proper disposal of e-cigarettes
                    because whether and how the disposal is regulated depends on who is throwing away the e-cigarette:

                        The electronics in vapes also pose a recycling problem. Theoretically, you could separate the
                        electronic components and bring them to a facility that accepts

                        Yet in these small devices, electronic parts such as coils and sensors are mixed in with plastic
                        and glass. It’s difficult and sometimes impossible to separate them out for recycling.
                        Disassembling
                        a vape also poses the risk of spilling the e-liquid.

                    <p>
                        Like so many hard-to-recycle items, there is little guidance from manufacturers or the
                        government
                        for
                        how to responsibly dispose of vaping products.

                    <p>
                        Not surprisingly, people who use vaping products are quite confused about proper disposal.

                        reported putting empty vapes either in the trash or in curbside recycling. A majority cited lack

                    <p>
                        The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has declared that e-cigarette waste and e-liquid waste
                        should be handled as
                        <a href="https://earth911.com/business-policy/do-you-have-household-hazardous-waste/"

                            waste</a>

                        from household hazardous waste guidelines. The FDA offers the following guidance:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Check with state and local resources for regulations and hazardous waste collection sites.
                        </li>
                        <li>Seal used vapes and keep no longer than 90 days before disposal.</li>
                        <li>Do not rinse e-liquid from cartridges — it will contaminate water.</li>
                        <li>Avoid getting e-liquid on skin, as it can be toxic.</li>
                        <li>Keep vapes away from kids and pets — the nicotine can be poisonous.</li>
