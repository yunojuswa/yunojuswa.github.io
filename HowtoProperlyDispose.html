                <p>When e-cigarettes, or vapes, came on the market in 2007, they were initially seen as 1) a healthier
                    alternative to smoking tobacco cigarettes and 2) a possible stepping stone to quitting smoking once
                    and for all. Unfortunately, the use of vapes has proven to have many

                    has always been the ease of use, an often avoided subject that must be at the forefront of the
                    conversation is how to dispose of disposable vapes correctly.
                </p>
                <p>As they rise in popularity, more and more people are getting rid of these vapes in the wrong way,
                    which poses a threat to the environment and causes vast losses of lithium—a material that exists in
                    limited quantities on the planet and is essential for new technologies, like electric car batteries.
                    So, what can vapers do?
                </p>
                <p>In this guide, we’ll show you the best way to recycle your disposable vapes and dispose of them
                    safely and responsibly in order to minimize the impact on the environment and our limited resources.

            <section id="guide" class="card">
                <p>Disposable vapes are simple devices that come prefilled with juice. They are intended for one-time
                    use only, hence the name disposable. Once the vape juice inside these devices runs out, they must be
                    disposed of.</p>
                <p>
                    The first disposables had low amounts of juice (2-5 mL) and non-rechargeable batteries. The concept
                    was that you buy a device, vape it till it’s empty, and dispose of it. In recent years, disposables
                    have gotten larger (some come with 15 mL of juice or more) and have been fitted with charging ports.
                    So, today, disposables are practically all-in-one non-refillable vapes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike most other vapes, which can only be found in vape shops, disposable vapes can also be found
                    in convenience stores, corner stores, and gas stations. Brands like EBDesign (

                    While it is true that disposables are easy to use and anyone can pick them up and start vaping,
                    you can’t throw away disposable vapes in your nearest garbage bin. This is because every
                    disposable vape comes with a lithium battery. Throwing these vapes in the garbage poses a fire
                    hazard, since these batteries can explode and/or cause a fire when compressed. They can also
                    release dangerous chemicals to local landfills, ultimately hurting our environment. More
                    importantly, there are only limited quantities of lithium on earth, so it is in our best
                    interest to recycle this resource, which is essential for technological progress.

                    You can properly dispose of and recycle disposable vapes in several ways. Let’s start from the
                    simplest and move on to the most complex methods.
                </p>
                <h2>Your local vape shop</h2>
                <p>
                    Believe it or not, your local vape shop might already have a recycling program for disposable
                    vapes. If this is the case, all you need to do is to visit them once your disposables are
                    finished and turn them in. If you don’t have a local vape shop, we suggest you look one up on
                    Google and call them to see if they offer any disposable recycling services.
                </p>
                <h2>Recycling programs offered by disposable vape manufacturers</h2>
                <p>
                    Another way you can dispose of and recycle disposable vapes is to return them to the manufacturer.
                    Many of the biggest manufacturers offer recycling programs. Below you can find some manufacturers
                    that will happily remove your disposable vapes from your hands and, in most cases, offer discounts
                    and free shipping.

                    Since every state has different regulations regarding the disposal of disposable vapes, we suggest

                <p>
                    Recycling disposable vapes is extremely important and easy to do. If your local vape shops or
                    manufacturers don’t run recycling programs, it’s worth checking for waste facilities in your area.
                    If you live in the United Kingdom, Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Facilities will
                    take the disposable vapes and quickly recycle them. In the United States, your best option is
                    Household Hazardous Waste (HHW) facilities.
